# ROMANI ITE DOMUM

This throw-away project just holds a JS coding exercise.
The goal of the exercise is using test-driven development (TDD) to implement functions for reading and writing Roman numerals.

There is no deeper connection to [Romnani Ite Domum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAdHEwiAy8).
Just a random Roman association that came to mind.
